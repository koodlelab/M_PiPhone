M_PiPhone - 10th birthday gift to my son.
=======

DIY phone/computer based on Raspberry Pi, PiTFT, GMS module and Lithium ion battery from Adafruit referencing from [Dave's Blog](http://www.davidhunt.ie/piphone-a-raspberry-pi-based-smartphone/)

I changed the phone orientation from the original program since it is still nice to use it more than just a phone.  Raspberry Pi is basically a computer, so the kid could use it for many other things and it is easier to work with Raspberry Pi with 90 degree orientation. Before I learn to use 3D printer, I added phone/computer case using shoe box cardboard for now.  For the phone program, close, mom, dad and home speed dial buttons are added to the touchscreen interface.
